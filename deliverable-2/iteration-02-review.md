## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday July 9th
 * Where: Slack (online)

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

- Not exclusively pair programming gave us the autonomy to work around our own schedules. Being in separate time zones with different commitments, our asynchronous style of development allowed us to not block each other, and keep development pace up.
- Multiple smaller pull-requests keep ourselves up to date on each other's work, enabling us to check for bugs and generally always be aware of the whole code base, which also helps with our more independent development style.
- Our initial high level feature prioritization was very sound. We managed to implement the most important features for the MVP on time, and managed to at least address the lesser of the two main features.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 - Splitting of features and component could have been more defined from the beginning. The tickets and issues created for features on our GitHub project board turned out to be very high level because we didn't solidify a granular enough design from the beginning. It ended up working out because we are both very capable, and made very reasonable assumptions and implementations, but we also had to communicate a bit more throughout to make sure the components interacted properly, rather than knowing the interfaces by designing them ahead of time.
 - Development process could have been more organized from the beginning, however we improved upon that. Having no real mandatory meetings meant that it was easy for time to slip away on the project when the deliverable deadline is more distant.


#### Q3. Planned changes

 * Although may be a requirement for the project regardless, we would like to add a CI/CD automated test suite that pull requests must pass, to ensure that newer features aren't breaking prior functionalities, allowing us to reason about our application's behaviour better.

 - Pull and manually test each other's feature branches for pull-requests to ensure we don't find bugs later on and can ensure our development and production branches are always working.
 - Plan features ahead of time together, and be more specific and detailed when creating issues for the project board, so that it is easier to just assign one to yourself, read the specs in the description, and implement it, rather than the more improvisational style we have been following. This will help assert more cohesion between our individually built features, and lead to a better overall architecture.
